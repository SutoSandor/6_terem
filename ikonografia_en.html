 <b>Cult of Mary the Helper (Mariahilf)</b><br><br>
This image type of Byzantine origin emphasizes the human side of the representation of the Mother of God, the emotional relationship between Mother and her Child. One of the first important devotional images of its appearance in Europe is the picture painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1537, which now can be seen on the high altar of St. Jakab's Church in Innsbruck. There are a number of known variants, of which the Passau copy was of particular significance during the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. The Emperor Leopold I escaped to Passau and prayed daily before the picture. Following the victory of 12 September 1683 in Vienna, the iconographic type of the image of Mary in Passau gained outstanding cultural historical importance and many copies of the devotional image got to Hungary. In the last quarter of the 17th century this type of image served as a helper against the Turks, in case of water hazard and plague.  The Franciscan Order, especially the Capuchins, played a significant role in its distribution. The main source of its representation spread in Hungary is the copy of the image in Passau, the Mariahilf image in Vienna depicting Mary and the child Jesus with crown.   <br><br>

<b>The cult of the Mariazell statue </b><br><br>
The Mariazell pilgrimage site and the cult of the Mariazell statue carved of linden around 1300 play a prominent role in the religious life of Hungarians. The Gothic chapel built in 1366 was erected by Hungarian King Louis the Great in memory of his victory over the Turks. Its devotional statue is Madonna on the throne. The Child sitting on Mary’s right knee is holding an apple in one of his hands and a fig in the other one, i.e. he is offering Mary a fruit of Paradise - who thus becomes "a New Eve”, and Jesus becomes a "new Adam" who changes the fruit of the fall to the fruit of redemption and obedience.<br><br>
 More than 50 copies of the devotional statue of Mariazell are known from the area of historical Hungary. Most of them have the same size and colour as the original. At the same time, several small-size copies have survived, all the way to the miniature replicas used as amulets. Among the copies there are significant differences in quality as well, ranging from the more artistically carved, carefully coloured pieces to the provincial, folk carvings.<br><br>
The dressing up and crowning of the statue originate from the common practice of religious life. Only Mary and the face of the Child are visible from the devotional statue dressed in a wide, conical apron. In the middle of the 18th century, the devotional statue of Mariazell had about 50 garments. Although at the end of the century Emperor Joseph II forbade the decoration of the devotional statue with clothes, crowns, pearls and jewels, after the death of the ruler, the cult of dressing and crowning the devotional statue flourished again. In 1793, the Madonna had 6 gold, 9 silver and 2 silk crowns embroidered with precious stones, but these had to be surrendered for the purposes of the French wars. The current 2 gold crowns were given as a present by the founder of the Basilica of Esztergom, Cardinal Prince Primate Sándor Rudnay. The translation of the Latin text on the crown of Mary: “To the Queen of Hungary and the source of the Zell grace - Prince Primate Rudnay". On the crown of little Jesus: “To the embodied Word, to the King and to the God-man as the sign of perpetual worship and gratitude, the Archbishop of Esztergom, Hungary".<br><br>

<b>Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows</b><br><br>
The term Our Lady of “Seven Sorrows" is based on the account of the sufferings that accompany the life of Virgin Mary. It is most often depicted as Mary with her heart pierced or beaten through with seven daggers or swords. Less commonly, the seven daggers are depicted as the halo around Mary's head, as well as the seven sorrows corresponding to the seven swords are depicted in seven scenes. <br><br>
Around Mary's figure. The origin of the cult has not been exactly clarified. Its evolvement is likely to be found in the intensifying passion-mysticism prompted by the crusades. It was especially the Franciscans and then the Servites who were keen to revive it. The later folk flourishing of her cult is attested by the many chapels erected in her honour, which are mostly found in cemeteries.<br><br>

<b>The pieta of Sasvár </b><br><br>
 The wooden carved pieta of the Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows parish church is the work of an unknown master from Upper Hungary dating from the early 16th century. According to the tradition, the wooden statue originally placed on a stone column was erected by count Imre Czobor and his wife Angelika Bakich in 1564 due to a pledge when in his sudden anger the Count chased his wife away, out of his coach. Angelika, in the knowledge of her innocence, pleaded and made a pledge before the wooden statue of the Sorrowful Mother (Pieta) by the road. Her husband reconciled with her the same day. To commemorate this miraculous event, Angelika had the statue of Mary placed on a stone column where she had made the pledge. After that mainly women and girls came here to pray.<br><br>
The statue was given in the care of Pauline monks in 1773 and finally placed in the chapel of the newly built church in 1762. Its small-size copies, rustic sculptural variants became widespread and popular souvenirs from indulgence pilgrimage events.<br><br>

<b>Patrona Hungariae</b><br><br>
The roots of the cult of the Virgin Mary can be traced back to St. Stephen I in our country. The legend of the king offering his country in the protection of the Virgin Mary is present as the most important tradition in both written and visual culture. From then on the Virgin Mary became Our Lady of Hungary (Magna Domina Hungarorum, Patrona Hungariae), and the Kingdom of Hungary became the kingdom of Mary (Regnum Marianum).<br><br>
The various manifestations of the cult have played an important role over the centuries. The motif of the offering of the country was later repeated by several of our kings (e.g. St. Ladislaus I, Louis I and Leopold I). With the strengthening of the reverence of the Hungarian Virgin Mary, a whole series of shrines were established throughout the country, mostly where wonderful phenomena or healings had occurred. In the Shrines of Mary, the object of the reverence is not a sacred relic, but an image or a statue of Mary bestowed with special gracious capabilities. In the Council of Trent, in the period of Catholic restoration and counter-reformation, the Franciscan and Jesuit order in particular urged the renewal of the cult of the Virgin Mary. From the beginning of the 16th century, the mentions of the motifs of the offering of the country and those of Patrona Hungariae had considerably increased, and gradually new elements were added.<br><br>
