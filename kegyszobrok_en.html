  <h1>Portable Mary sculpture under a baldachin</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">

  The role of Mary sculptures carried on a rod under a baldachin was significant in the case of pilgrimages and processions. These sculptures were carried by the Mary-girls in the processions of the churches' titular indulgence event for the purpose of thanksgiving or pleading. A procession is distinguished from a pilgrimage by the leadership of a priest. The route of the procession and that of the pilgrimage are governed by local traditions. The marching of the masses of praying and singing believers is managed in a given order. The clergy, priests and religious associations take part in the processions in their own garments, and believers take part in their Sunday best or clothing indicating repentance (men with an uncovered head). Each group carries a procession flag, cross, candle or other portable artefacts of worship.<br><br>

The baldachin is held by the voluted columns located on the four corners of the pedestal. Originally the columns may have been painted blue, the column caps red and the baldachin was green. The globe on the top shows traces of gold plating, and it was previously decorated with a cross, which had been sawn off. The carved and painted sculpture of Mary is attached to the middle of the baldachin architecture by pins. The sculpture matches the type of Madonna of Kiskunság. The characteristics of this type: Blessed Virgin, with little Jesus on her left arm, stylized crowns with a Latin cross on both of them. The chest part of Mary's red, long dress is embellished with pearls or dog-tooth motifs. Their origin can probably be related to folk carvings around Sasvár in Upper Hungary. <br><br>

<b>Mary sculpture dressing</b><br><br>
The habit of dressing up Mary sculptures in Catholicism varies periodically and by region. Its fulfilment was achieved in the Baroque age and it was most often associated with the Rosary Associations. The main types of Mary dresses had been created by the 18th century. A tight, conical dress was put on the Maria sculptures of Loreto, an apron-shaped dress was put on the Altötting devotional sculpture and a wide, conical apron on the Mariazell sculpture. <br><br>
Initially the expensive material of the dress chosen according to the church liturgy was usually provided as a gift by the members of aristocratic, noble classes - e.g. King Louis I (Great) left his and his wife’s wedding dress to Mariazell. The dresses were often decorated with expensive gems. In the age of Enlightenment Joseph II forbade the decoration of the devotional sculpture with garments, crowns, pearls, jewels, but after his death the habit re-emerged. Lace collars and lace cuffs as well as long flowery embroidered dresses are the most widespread. Grapes and wheatears, as symbols showing the mystery of redemption, as symbols referring to the Eucharist are also often seen on the garments of little Jesus.<br><br>
The dressing of the sculptures was also intertwined with the carrying of the sculpture in some places. The sculptures to be dressed used in the sacred acts were typically carved only to the hip, and below that instead of the plastic shaping only a simple supporting structure had been prepared. Besides the dressing, the crowning of the sculpture and provision with jewels and rosaries were also part of the tradition. <br><br>
