  <h1>Marian Cult in Máriabesnyő</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg"> 
   The introduction of the cult of the Virgin Mary in Máriabesnyő is attributed to Antal Grassalkovich I, founder of the church and his wife, Terézia Klobusiczky. Originally the first shrine modelled on Loreto chapel in Italy was intended by the Count and his wife for private use and its construction began in 1759. At this time, during the construction, as a miraculous event, a small statuette of Virgin Mary holding her child on her right arm, carved from bone was found, which was to become the cult object of the shrine and future place of pilgrimage - even surpassing the religious respect of the devotional statue of Loreto.<br><br>
    In the chapel of Besnyő, the religious countess performed her devotions on Saturdays, but due to her example and the statue of the Virgin Mary found in miraculous conditions significant numbers of people started to visit the shrine. The count decided to construct a church in front the chapel that had become small for the visitors and in 1763 he built a monastery for the purpose of taking care of the shrine and settled Capuchin fathers here.  <br><br>
    Its importance in folk religion was based on the many miraculous events of prayers being answered and healings occurring. Its popularity as a place of pilgrimage has grown over time, believers have made pilgrimages here from far away to pray under the protection of the miraculous Holy Virgin. One of the events attracting large masses in the history of the shrine was the occasion of the four-day centenary indulgence pilgrimage event in September 1863, during the celebration of the Nativity of Mary. According to the records, about fifty thousand pilgrims were present at the celebration. The bishop opened the ceremony and encouraged those present in his holy speech to honour the Virgin Mary. The number of pilgrims increased steadily until 1949. The two most important of these celebrations are the main feast of the Assumption of Mary and the day of the Nativity of Mary.<br><br>
