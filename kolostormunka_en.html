  <h1>Monastery work</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
A sacred picture, relief or wax sculpture incorporated in a box-shaped, deep frame, surrounded by meticulous work of handicraft decoration similar to filigree. The earliest known pieces were made for church use, typically for the representational placement of relics. Later, in the 18th century, they were made for sale in some monasteries. Their predecessors can be the works consisting of scene-like layers modelled on the Baroque so-called "Holy Theatres". The decorations generally characteristic of monastery works are metal wires, laces, chenille, pearls and wax. The faces were painted on parchment.  <br><br>
Their 19th century versions are the so-called “covered" bottles containing wax saints. <br><br>
Most of the Hungarian monastery works date back to the 18th century, they were found in the western part of the country. They were generally made by the Franciscan, Salesian and Ursuline nuns.
