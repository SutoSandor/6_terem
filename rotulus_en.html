  <h1>“Rotulus of Máriabesnyő"</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">

Parchment, watercolour, feather, 150 x 10 cm, 18th century, damaged, its lower end is fragmented. It contains Latin and German Franciscan prayers inspired by St. Francis of Assisi and it is decorated with motifs of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Holy Cross. The work of an unknown Franciscan or Capuchin author.<br><br>
The parchment roll glued together from two parts was discovered in July 2008 by the museologists of the Gödöllő Town Museum and Terézia Kerny, an art historian in a carved chest during the preparation for the new permanent exhibition of the Marian Museum of Máriabesnyő.<br><br>
“On one side of the roll written horizontally in brown ink in German texts are the petitions, based on the prayers of St. Francis of Assisi, to the Holy Lance (!), the Holy Spirit, the Three Kings of the Bible and the four Evangelists. On the other side of the roll the Latin text is not from a single, long piece of work, but it consists of units of different content. Among others, there is a prayer to St. Michael as well as to Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel archangels, imploration to Saint Agatha. There are many illustrations in the texts: different types of crucifixes: Tau-cross, Arma Christi ("Capuchin Cross"), Calvary with heavily bleeding Christ, Zechariah and other blessings on Caravaca cross with a picture of a Pieta statue and a crucifix depicted by Satan's symbol (snake). In addition, bust of the Immaculate Virgin in a tondo depicted with three roses on her head with Jesus monogram; Pope St. Clement with the Veil of Veronica and St. Michael Archangel in Roman Legion uniform.<br><br>
After figurative representations symbolic Christian (Chi-Rho, IHS and Mary monograms, Jesus - the Sacred Heart of the Virgin Mary) and carefully structured geometric diagrams, magical signs: runic writing, Arabic, Hebrew inscriptions, letters, magic squares with the system of the number fifteen and thirty originating form China and India, inscribed circles, pentagrams, hexagrams ("Ring of Solomon”) are connected.<br><br>
The roots of these symbols used in magical practices are to be found in the Gnostic texts of Egyptian magic papyri and in Jewish Christian numerology, i.e. it is based on Christian Gnosis built on the teachings of Pythagoras and Jewish Kabbalah, which tried to find a better explanation for the purpose of human existence by complex hermetic, esoteric methods and numerical correlations, and hoped to acquire salvation by acquiring them. Since the interpretation of the text and graphics of the rotulus can be - partly - explained from this direction, some basic concepts need clarification. The very extensive and practically incomprehensible, but in Hungary scarcely-practiced scientific magic research distinguishes four major types of learned magic: talisman, natural, fortune-telling and ritual magic, which can be divided into further subtypes.<br><br>
The text of ritual magic is based on the most famous and popular magical books of the Middle Ages, on the relatively large number of preserved manuscripts of Ars Notoria and Claviculae Salamonis attributed to Salamon as well as on the Book of Visions (Liber visionum) of Mary’s visions written by Jean de Morigny (Johannes de Morigniaco, +1350), a Benedictine monk, which was discovered rather late for purposes of research. The first two works, totally unacceptable for Christian theology, promised their users intellectual perfection, the rapid acquisition of the seven liberal arts, knowledge, eloquence, memory development and the quick understanding of difficult books, but gave information on lost treasures, ghosts of the dead and demons, past or future by listing a variety of rituals, including the names of the gods used in crystal magic (Adonay, Sabaoth, El, Eli, Soter, Emmanuel, Alpha et Omega, Tetragrammaton) and the angel names used in angel-magic through the series of prayers addressed to them, with the help of pseudo-Arabic, pseudo-Hebrew, pseudo-Chaldean letters and words, the so-called verba ignotus. The person involved in the ritual was preparing for the meeting with the spirits from whom he had expected the help with a series of ascetic preparation, purification, fasting and prayers.<br><br>
 In the Middle Ages from this tradition Benediction was developed as well as exorcism, the practice of the removal of devil or other evil spirits from man or place. In the 16th - 17th centuries following the provisions of the Council of Trent the radically changed liturgical practice omitted most of them from the ritual books, however, some of them survived in collections or manuscripts published, for example, by Franciscan, Jesuit monks or in manuscripts in the early modern centuries, moreover, based on the earlier models new ones were written using smaller textual elements. The tools of the exorcist blessed with priestly or special powers and abilities were often the same orations that were used in ritual magic. That is to say, the exorcist often called upon God the Father, Jesus, the major or minor angels, and used all the prayers, mandatory texts, gestures, symbols, emblems, and amulets which were used by ritual magic.<br><br>
For the interpretation of the rotulus of Máriabesnyő the other essential type is astral or talisman magic. During this ceremony terrestrial creatures and ghosts were evoked through various magic seals, magic rings and letters. The texts of talisman magic have also survived in relatively large numbers since the Middle Ages. Their structure is simple. The manuscripts usually originate from the Arabic book on magic titled Picatrix written in the 11th century and translated into Spanish in 1256 in the court of Alfonso X of Castile (the Wise) (1221-1284). Its title is a distorted form of the name Hippocrates, which is often found in the text. The unknown author mainly drew on the work of Arabic writers, but he was also aware of Hellenistic and Roman magic literature, and even old Greek philosophy to a small extent. Novelistic elements, shorter-length stories also emerge among magical recipes, scientific and philosophical contemplations with the primary purpose of verifying the efficacy of each magical process and talisman.<br><br>
Another inseparable part of talisman magic was Scandinavian runic writing, which has its origins in the Book of Runes (Liber runarum). The letters of the rune, like the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, contained some kind of, sometimes several, meanings, and formed the most secret part of the evocation.<br><br>
This kind of ritual also used the "squares of the seven planets", i.e. the magical squares, about the use of which there were also various documents available. The best-known of them is the work titled De septem quadraturis planetarum seu quadrati magici. The smallest was the 3 x 3 square, where the sum of the number in the cells added in any direction made 15. Each square corresponded to a planet. If the square was engraved in the metal of the given planet, they could turn to the matching planetary spirits for help. 3x3 and 4x4 type squares can be seen on the rotulus of Máriabesnyő. (The latter one is also depicted on the engraving Melancolia by Albrecht Dürer [1514]).<br><br>
In addition to the magical petitions and signs, the texts and illustrations of the rolls of Máriabesnyő are clearly based on the Franciscan suffering mysticism, precisely it can be approached from the stigmatization of St. Francis of Assisi, who during the fasting of St. Michael Archangel, commencing with the Feast of the Blessed Virgin in 1224, during the Feast of the Holy Cross (September 14) received the Five Sacred Wounds of Christ. After that, many pious societies were established spreading respect for the sacred wounds, there are many prayers to them. The best-known of them is the prayer of St. Clare, which she learned from St. Francis and prayed daily.<br><br>
The rotulus of Máriabesnyő including a magical apparatus, being on the edge of the "demonic and sacral world", could be the product of late Franciscan or Capuchin Occultism.<br><br>
The process of the learned (white) magic can be clearly reconstructed from it, which includes a mix of ritual and talisman magic and the Franciscan-Capuchin mix. It contains few original ideas. Its author updated the stereotype texts and signs known from the Middle Ages. Its purpose is to avert the various natural disasters, especially the plague which was very common in the 2nd half of the 18th Century.  The intent of averting disasters is found in all prayers and depictions.<br><br>

Primarily people with sore eyes and heart diseases turned to Saint Longinus, to the Holy Spear figuratively, but according to a German plea from the settlement of Pécsvárad, the prayer addressed to him worked against all pains.<br><br>
The prayer to Saint Michael and the good angels summoned by rituals and invocation prayer formulas well-known in the European angel magic tradition was evidently the most powerful method to summon ghosts and exorcize evil, but it also protected against the plague due to one of the points of the Archangel’s legend connected Rome.<br><br>
Pope St. Clement holding the Veil of Veronica was the patron of shippers, hatters, marble cutters, sailors and miners, but he also used to be called upon to help against thunderstorms, shipwrecks, children’s diseases, and indirectly referred to the great Capuchin mystic, Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660-1727).<br><br>
The prayer to St. Agatha was used to avert fire in the Middle Ages, and in the Baroque centuries women with breast diseases prayed to her. Agatha died in jail in around 251 AD. Angels placed a marble slab on her tomb with the following inscription: "MENTEM SANCTAM + SPONTANEAM + HONOREM DEO + ET PATRIAE LIBERATIONEM" (Holy and ready mind, respect for God and liberation to the home country). Starting from the early modern period data from many parts of Europe prove the use of the so-called Agatha note, which appears as a sacramental in historical sources and ethnographical descriptions. The notes that were pinned on the doors of the houses and in the case of fire were thrown in the fire, also included the extension of the quoted epitaph with a few words ("Ignis a laesura protege nos, o Agatha pia"), in which they prayed to Agatha to avert the fire. A shorter, unextended version of the text is also located on the former main gate of the Esztergom Basilica, on the Porta speciosa.<br><br>
The Five Sacred Wounds of Christ was efficient protection against famine and epidemic in the 16th century. The esoteric cross-symbolism rooted in the Franciscan tradition also had an exorcising and anti-plague role. Of these crosses I would only refer to the letter magic plague cross appearing during the plagues of the 18th century, otherwise referred to as the Zechariah cross, in which probably the Pieta of Sasvár is visible in this case. The letters of the Zechariah Cross are the initials of biblical sayings, which, as it is known from the research of Sándor Bálint and Zoltán Szilárdfy, were used to avert an epidemic that was interpreted as the work of the evil spirit, sometimes identified with it.<br><br>
Who wrote the text? Undoubtedly a cleric, who actually used absolutely simple, standard magic recipes, formulas and ceremonies well-known in learned magic, whose structure can be immediately recognized by a historian of magic at a glance. However, the figures and diagrams were used rather chaotically and randomly. For this reason, perhaps it is not a completely hasty conclusion to suspect that the author himself was not completely aware of the meaning of some of the signs either. This fact, on the other hand, suggests that the author was not experienced in magic, but he may have known the magical tracts, i.e. the commonly circulating basic texts and exemplum collections already known from the Middle Ages. And this indicates that there was institutional background, in fact a well-supplied library behind him. For the time being it cannot be concluded in which works he read the instructions, what he had used for his manuscript, i.e. what the direct source could have been. It could be a manuscript(s) that is secretly distributed by copying and domestic work(s) could also be the source. In the Middle Ages learned magic and in particular ritual magic was not unknown among monks, and it remained like this in the modern age as well. In a monastery library, hidden from the prying eyes, there may have been many magical manuscripts or documents. On the one hand, because they had to know these illicit works ex officio, and on the other hand, because they well matched and supplemented the medical and pharmaceutical books. The Capuchins operated a number of pharmacies, their herbal remedies were popular products all over Europe. During the laboratory work they could have naturally come to know medical, pharmacological and alchemical works which included magical recipes too, and they themselves made such manuscripts for the purpose of averting problems, which later became a magical object.<br><br>
Similarly to the texts, the predecessor of most of the illustrations can be accurately determined by commonly known on the basis of altar-pieces or small graphics.<br><br>
It cannot be ruled out that it is the work of one hand, or that it was written in Máriabesnyő, but of course other Capuchin monasteries can be considered. Unfortunately, in the previous two hundred and fifty years the Capuchin library in Máriabesnyő had a troubled past, and most of its material was lost.<br><br>
Despite all the stereotypes of the roll it is a very valuable relic because due to the strong dogmatic control of Counter-Reformation there are very few manuscripts left of this kind of literature in Hungary which gives a glimpse into the local reception of 18th century magical works. The Sacred Heart of Jesus symbol may be the key to dating the roll, whose liturgical respect, although to a limited extent, was approved by Pope Clement XIII (1758-1769) in 1765."<br><br>
