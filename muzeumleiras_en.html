  <h1>The Marian Museum of Máriabesnyő</h1>
  <br>

  <p id="szoveg">
    The creation of the collection is attributed to Géza Kátai, a Roman Catholic priest, who started gathering the memorial material - primarily including written and other relics of the Hungarians’ veneration of Mary and those of folk religion - in Petőfiszállás in Bács-Kiskun County in 1981. When he was relocated to Gödöllő in 1989, he brought the collection to Máriabesnyő, where László Tamás Nagy (1955-2000), a chief Capuchin monk, who had then returned to the monastery with the Capuchin monks, took care of the collection. In the beginning the pieces of the collection were exhibited in the monastery's cells, and then as the material continued to grow, a separate “Marian Museum" was created at the back of the monastery's court.  In 2001, after the death of László Tamás Nagy, part of the collection was taken back to Petőfiszállás and the rest was taken into the former monk cells of the monastery of Máriabesnyő. This latter group of relics was organized and processed in August 2008, when a new permanent exhibition was opened thanks to the museologists of Gödöllő Town Museum and the curatorial work of Teréz Kerny (1957-2015), art historian. Due to the unfavourable conditions of the exhibition space in Máriabesnyő the exhibition was closed in 2011 and later the collection was placed in the Gödöllő Town Museum. <br><br>

    <b>László Tamás Nagy (1955-2000)</b><br><br>
    He was born in Budapest in a railroad workers’ family, and graduated from the College of Theology in Eger.<br><br>
    In 1979, he was ordained a priest in the Vác Cathedral by József Bánk, bishop-archbishop of Vác. From 1983 he worked in Vác and in its district as a chaplain. <br><br>
    In 1986, the bishop of Vác appointed him parish priest in Kosd, where he renovated the parish building and created a cave of Lourdes. He had the monument of the local chaplain, Lőrinc Eöszi prepared, who died during the 1742 plague epidemic while looking after patients.<br><br>
    In 1987 he entered the Capuchin order, where he professed his perpetual vow in 1991. From 1990 he was the parish priest of Máriabesnyő, reviving the shrine zealously and tirelessly. He managed the reconstruction of the Grassalkovich crypt, the paving of the churchyard and turning it into an open air shrine, the establishment of the shop of religious artefacts and the establishment of a patient care home in Fenyvesi road. His main concern was the managing and constant growth of the Marian Museum.<br><br>
    He received the Gödöllő City Prize for his devoted activities in 2000.<br><br>
    The Capuchin monk community elected him the provincial leader in 1974 and then in 1997. In his 21st year of being a minister he died unexpectedly in Máriabesnyő.<br><br>
